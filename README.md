Description of public dataset (https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-provider-charge-data/)

As part of the Obama administrationâ€™s work to make our health care system more affordable and accountable, data are being released that summarize the utilization and payments for procedures, services, and prescription drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries by specific inpatient and outpatient hospitals, physicians, and other suppliers. These data include information for the 100 most common inpatient services, 30 common outpatient services, all physician and other supplier procedures and services, and all Part D prescriptions. Providers determine what they will charge for items, services, and procedures provided to patients and these charges are the amount the providers bill for an item, service, or procedure.

Please use the navigation bar to the left to view more information on the inpatient, outpatient, physician and other supplier, and Part D prescriber analyses and to access the data for download. Data are being made available in Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) format and raw text file data format (comma separated values (.csv) for inpatient and outpatient and tab delimited for physician and other supplier and Part D prescriber).

For answers to any questions about the data, please see our Frequently Asked Questions page.

Inquiries regarding this data can be sent to MedicareProviderData@cms.hhs.gov.
